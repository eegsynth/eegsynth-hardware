# Art-Net to DMX

This hardware module receives control signals over Art-Net (i.e. UDP packets) over a wireless connection. The Art-Net packets are passed on to a wired DMX interface.

This hardware works well with the *outputartnet* Python module.

The Arduino code for the firmware of this device can be found on [github](https://github.com/robertoostenveld/arduino/tree/master/esp8266_artnet_dmx512).
