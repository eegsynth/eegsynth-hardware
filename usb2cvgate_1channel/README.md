# USB to CV/Gate

This is a one-channel version of a CV/Gate controller. It comprises of an Arduino Nano combined with a 12-bit DAC module. The output voltage is between 0 and 5 V, or slightly less. The maximum output voltage depends on the output of your USB port and of the voltage controller in the Arduino Nano.

This hardware works well with the *outputcvgate* Python module.
